# React Employee Directory 🧾👥

## User Story
```
As an employee of an organization

I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 

So that I have quick access to their information.
```
## Business Context 👨‍💼

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Features 🌠

A Seed of employees is provided to preload the application with example data. The user is then able to add their own employees, providing: first name, last name, and email.

The user is able to sort employees by:
* firstname descending
* firstname ascending
* lastname descending
* lastname ascending
* email descending
* email ascending

As well as filter by:
* lastname a-m
* lastname n-z
